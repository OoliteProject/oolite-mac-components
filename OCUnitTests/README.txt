This project contains OCUnit/SenTestingKit unit tests.

These can be run from within the main Xcode project by selecting Product → Test
with any of the predefined schemes selected. They will also run at the end of
any TestRelease or Deployment build (including nightlies).

Test failures appear as error messages in the Issues Navigator.


A very old version of OCUnit which nominally supports GNUstep can be found
here: http://www.sente.ch/software/ocunit/

Unfortunately, the names of all the testing macros have changed since then and
that version apparently only works with the Apple Objective-C runtime anyway,
so without a significant amount of work the unit tests are Mac-only.
